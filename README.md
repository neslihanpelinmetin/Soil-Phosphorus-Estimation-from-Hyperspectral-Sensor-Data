# Soil Phosphorus Estimation from Hyperspectral Sensor Data

This repository contains the code accompanying the article:

> N. P. Metin, N. Panahi, Y. Cimtay, **"Investigating the Use of Graph Convolutional Networks on Soil Phosphorus Estimation from Hyperspectral Sensor Data"**.

The project investigates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting soil phosphorus concentration from hyperspectral reflectance spectra in the 200–900 nm range. The code implements the full pipeline described in the paper: band selection with Mutual Information Regression, data augmentation, Min–Max scaling, k-NN graph construction, and model training with extensive hyperparameter grid search.
